# Weather App

Weather App is a web application developed during my "Web Development" course at IT School. It provides real-time weather information for various cities and a 5-day weather forecast. The project focuses on utilizing web technologies and APIs to deliver weather data in an accessible and user-friendly manner.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Markup language for structuring the webpage.
CSS: Styling for a visually appealing user interface.
Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive design.
JavaScript: Used for interactivity, including fetching and displaying weather data.
OpenWeatherMap API: Integration with OpenWeatherMap API to access real-time weather data.
